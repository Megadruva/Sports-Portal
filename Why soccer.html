          <dd>Soccer is a fast paced game that is with multiple people in a team. You need to have an even amount of people to make fair teams. You need only a ball to play soccer because it is easy to make goals. An official Soccer game is 90 minutes but if you are playing for fun you can just play for as long as you want. </dd>
